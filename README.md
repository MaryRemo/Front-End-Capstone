#### Front-End-Capstone
A React App that randomly generates activities for a user that they can share with friends! I built this app because I realized I always did the same old thing(watch Netflix on my couch). I wanted to create something that would get me out of that rut!  I used  React to access the TheBoredAPI so that the user could click a button to randomly generate an activity that the user could save to their personal activity board. If they choose to share it their friends will be able see it. The user can also see activities that their friends have shared. Users can edit and delete these  activities. The user also if they choose can follow and  unfollow other users.I styled the app using CSS and Bootstrap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
